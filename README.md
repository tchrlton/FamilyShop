## Description

Grocery Shopping just got easier! FamilyShop is an application that uses a real-time grocery shopping list for users to share their grocery list with their friend and/or family. Users can add, edit, or delete an item from the list
and also mark whether the item has been purchased. When the item has been purchased, a checkmark appears next to the item in the shopping list. If the user makes a mistake and gets the wrong item, they can edit the item and mark it unpurchased, 
which makes the checkmark disappear. The data is updated in real-time by using a PSQL database so that the item will be shown as added, edited, deleted, or purchased. The back-end of the application was made using Node.js and Express and the front-end 
was made using HTML5 with EJS as a middleware. I have done some projects on Node.js and EJS so I feel as though my comfortability level with them is good. 

If I had more time, I would have definitely styled the app a bit more with bootstrap such as adding in pictures for the items and also creating a bigger, full span background image for the home page. I would have also added icons for the labels on the
home page. Another feature I would have implemented would be having all of the actions for the items on the shopping list like edit and deleting items as well as a purchased button. As of now, I have them seperated into their own ejs files and routes. This would
make the application easier and more manageable for the user. Another feature I would have added was to make a priority list for the items to make sure the user will see what is needed now and what can wait. Another feature I would have added is to add multiple types of list
so you can not just have the use of the application be at the grocery store but at several stores. I made the application simple and easy to use to make it a minimal viable product first and then tried to add as much nice to haves as I could. I really enjoyed making a real-world 
groccery shopping list so that I could use it myself when I go to the store!
